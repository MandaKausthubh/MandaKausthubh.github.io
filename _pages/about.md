<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template! -->

I'm Kausthubh Manda, a pre-final year Integrated MTech (Btech + Mtech) student at IIIT Bangalore. I'm an aspiring researcher who's interested in the intersection of Mathematics and Machine Learning. My specific interests include ML theory, Reinforcement Learning, Optimisation and LLMs. I'm currently a member of [Dr. Aswin Kannan's research group](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/aswin-kannan) working in Multi-Objective Optimization Theory.

Apart from this I've also worked with [Dr. Raghuram Bharadwaj](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/raghuram-bharadwaj), in which I'm studying the effectivness (or rather the lack of it) in popular RL algorithms through Differential Inclusions. This work done as a part of the course: Advanced Reinforcement Learning (AIT 848@IIIT B), which is a reseach driven course through which I've gotten a [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20220). I have also previously worked with [Dr. Naganand Yadati](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/naganand), under whom I've investigated Continual Learning for Supervised Fine-Tuning.
