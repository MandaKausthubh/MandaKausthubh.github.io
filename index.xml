&lt;p>Given a sequence of Random Variables that act as I.I.Ds (Identical Independently Distributions) $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3} \dots Z_{n}$ with mean $\mu$ and $\mathbf{P}(a \leq Z_{i} \leq b) = 1$ then for any $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$ we have the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;p>
&lt;p>
$$
\mathbf{P}(|\bar{Z}_{n} > \epsilon |) \leq 2 \exp\left( \frac{-2n\epsilon^{2}}{(b-a)^{2}} \right)
&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>
$$
&lt;p>where $\bar{Z}&lt;em>{n}=\frac{1}{N} \sum&lt;/em>{i=1}^{N}Z_{i}$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why should anyone care about this at all?? This is well explained in Abu Mostafa&amp;rsquo;s book: &lt;strong>Learning from data: A Short Course&lt;/strong>. This is an excellent book for anyone to get started on theoretical machine learning and is a must read. This book was based on the course that he had taught at &lt;strong>CalTech&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Curriculum Vitae</title><link>https://mandakausthubh.github.io/pages/aboutme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 03:53:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mandakausthubh.github.io/pages/aboutme/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I am Kausthubh Manda. I&amp;rsquo;m an undergraduate student studying computer science@IIIT Bangalore. I work in various fields of AI and ML. My goals in life are to contribute to cutting edge research in these fields. I am currently exploring Multi-Objective-Optimization Theory and it&amp;rsquo;s applications in Machine Learning. I am also exploring other fields in Machine Learing such as Theory of Generalization and Deep Learning. My projects however do include topics in Computer Vision and Foundational Models.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overview of Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://mandakausthubh.github.io/posts/reinforcement-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 03:53:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mandakausthubh.github.io/posts/reinforcement-learning/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="aim-832-reinforcement-learning">AIM 832: Reinforcement Learning&lt;/h2></description></item></channel></rss>
