I&amp;rsquo;m an undergraduate student studying computer science@IIIT Bangalore. I work in various fields of AI and ML. My goals in life are to contribute to cutting edge research in these fields. I am currently exploring Multi-Objective-Optimization Theory and it&amp;rsquo;s applications in Machine Learning. I am also exploring other fields in Machine Learing such as Theory of Generalization and Deep Learning. My projects however do include topics in Computer Vision and Foundational Models.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hoeffding's Inequality and Generalization</title><link>https://mandakausthubh.github.io/posts/generalisation-theory/proof-of-hoeffdings-inequality/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 03:53:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mandakausthubh.github.io/posts/generalisation-theory/proof-of-hoeffdings-inequality/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="what-is-hoeffdings-inequality-">What is Hoeffding&amp;rsquo;s Inequality ?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Given a sequence of Random Variables that act as I.I.Ds (Identical Independently Distributions) $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3} \dots Z_{n}$ with mean $\mu$ and $\mathbf{P}(a \leq Z_{i} \leq b) = 1$ then for any $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$ we have the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
$$
\mathbf{P}(|\bar{Z}_{n} - \mu| > \epsilon) \leq \exp\left( \frac{-2n\epsilon^{2}}{(b-a)^{2}} \right)
$$
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where $\bar{Z_{n}}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}Z_{i}$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why should anyone care about this at all?? This is well explained in Abu Mostafa&amp;rsquo;s book: &lt;strong>Learning from data: A Short Course&lt;/strong>. This is an excellent book for anyone to get started on theoretical machine learning and is a must read. This book was based on the course that he had taught at &lt;strong>CalTech&lt;/strong>. Although this book doesn&amp;rsquo;t go into the actual proof of Hoeffding&amp;rsquo;s in-equality this blog aims of explaining Hoeffding&amp;rsquo;s inequality in a rigorous manner while also providing great intuition. &lt;em>Most of this blog is originally taken, rather blatantly, from Stanford CS229: Supplemental Lecture notes: Hoeffding&amp;rsquo;s inequality.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
